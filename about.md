## About Me

{: style="text-align:center"}
![image-title-here](https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/1785642){:class="img-responsive" style="border:2px solid black"}

* I live in Asheville, NC with my wife, five children, two dogs and fifteen chickens.
* I like [experiments](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/01/04/rules-of-programming-experiments/).
  I learn best through trying and most of all from getting it wrong. Most of my more
  interesting experiments survive on [Github](https://github.com/pliniker).
* My interests are programming languages and their implementation. In the long term
  I want to see some languages runtimes implemented on Rust. Most of my experiments
  are in that direction. I'm organizing a [Languages Hosted In Rust](https://github.com/rust-hosted-langs/)
  group aimed at bringing together folk with a shared interest in this.
* After twenty years of doing nothing much with music - last used FastTracker 2 in '98 -
  I'm learning [Bitwig Studio](https://bitwig.com). I'll post anything that turns out
  not too terrible to [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-885707709).
* Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/peterliniker) and
  [Github](https://github.com/pliniker).
