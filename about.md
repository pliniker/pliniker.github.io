## About Me

* Originally from Wales, I live in Asheville, North Carolina with my wife,
  where much of our time is engaged in our five childrens' creative interests
  or simply managing the chaos together.
* I'm a Christian. I love the prophetic and hearing God through dreams, visions
  and impressions, following God and discovering God's nature and who I am in
  light of who Jesus is. The daily question of this life is, as a certain
  prophet put it, "Did you learn to love?"

* While software engineering is impressive, to me, code is art.
* I started a PhD back when I thought academic life would be my life, but it
  turned out I just like writing beautiful code.
* It also turns out that irrational business demands don't make coding too
  fun either.
* Code is art :-)
* I want to see a variety of language runtimes implemented in
  Rust as an alternative to the many C implemented languages. I want to leave
  the state of software in a better place for the future.
  I'm part of the [Languages Hosted In Rust](https://github.com/rust-hosted-langs/)
  group aimed at bringing together folk with a shared interest in enabling this.
* Back in 1998 I played around with music in FastTracker 2 and baked my own
  [homebrewed mod player](https://github.com/pliniker/attic/tree/master/archive/to-1998/asm2/demo4)
  in '96. Between then and now I've done next to nothing musical but I do enjoy
  messing around in [Bitwig Studio](https://bitwig.com) these days.
  Anything that turns out not too terrible will find it's way to
  [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-885707709).
  I fool around on piano and ukulele on occasion.
* Connect with me on
  [Github](https://github.com/pliniker) and
  [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/pliniker). I am also reachable in the
  [Gitter Rust-Hosted-Langs](https://gitter.im/rust-hosted-langs/runtimes-WG)
  channel, the
  [Rust Zulip](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/) server and as `pliniker#8777`
  on the official Rust and Rust Community Discord servers.
