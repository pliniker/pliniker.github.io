I like [experiments](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/01/04/rules-of-programming-experiments/).
Mine typically don't work, I feel not very smart, but hopefully I learn something!

My interests are programming languages and their implementation, and machine learning.
I don't know a whole lot about either.

Sometimes I'm on [moznet](https://wiki.mozilla.org/IRC) as `pliniker`.
