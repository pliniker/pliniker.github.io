## About Me

* I'm part of the [Languages Hosted In Rust](https://github.com/rust-hosted-langs/)
  group aimed at bringing together folk with a shared interest in this.
  In the long term I want to see a variety of language runtimes implemented on
  Rust as an alternative to the many C implemented languages.

* I like [experiments](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/01/04/rules-of-programming-experiments/).
  I learn best through trying and most of all from getting it wrong. Most of my more
  interesting experiments survive on [Github](https://github.com/pliniker).
* After twenty years of doing nothing much with music, last used FastTracker 2 in '98
  and [homebrewed mod player](https://github.com/pliniker/attic/tree/master/archive/to-1998/asm2/demo4)
  in '96, I'm working with [Bitwig Studio](https://bitwig.com).
  Anything that turns out not too terrible will find it's way to
  [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/user-885707709).
* Originally from the UK, I live in Asheville, NC with my wife, five children,
  two dogs and fifteen chickens.
* Connect with me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/peterliniker) and
  [Github](https://github.com/pliniker).
